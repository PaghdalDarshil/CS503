# 2. I have installed my virtual machine, tested it, feel comfortable using it, and validated that the required software is installed:
- [x] YES
- [ ] N/A - I plan to use tux
- [ ] NO - Not Yet

# 3. Please provide a link to the repository you are using for this class:

# 4. Briefly describe what you want to get out of this class:
I want to gain a strong understanding of the Unix/Linux environment from both application development and systems programming perspectives. Specifically, I aim to master key topics like compilers, linkers, memory management, concurrency, and network programming in C. My goal is to deepen my knowledge of operating systems and their interaction with hardware, ultimately improving my skills.

# 5. Briefly describe any concerns you might be having with being successful in this class (if any):  
My main concern is ensuring that I can effectively manage the workload alongside other responsibilities, particularly mastering advanced topics like concurrency and low-level programming in C. Additionally, I want to ensure I am well-prepared for assignments that may require significant time investment in debugging and testing code in a Linux environment.
